Mahonia
Gardens
is
a
oneacre
market
garden
in
Sisters
Oregon
The
farmers
use
organic
practices
and
emphasize
biodiversity
Their
practices
align
with
the
idea
that
quality
soil
creates
quality
food
Benji
and
Carys
founded
Mahonia
Gardens
in
making
their
th
season
Prior
to
that
they
had
worked
on
a
variety
of
farms
in
southern
Oregon
and
abroad
participated
in
fullseason
internships
in
California
and
studied
and
practiced
Permaculture
principles
Labor
on
the
farm
is
done
by
hand
using
efficient
and
ergonomic
hand
tools
While
they
have
a
history
of
offering
a
traditional
CSA
program
farmers
markets
and
wholesale
the
farmers
now
sell
most
of
our
produce
through
their
farm
stand
“
The
Stand
”
where
they
have
steadily
brought
in
veggies
flowers
flour
honey
berries
etc
from
other
local
farms
in
addition
to
their
own
produce
They
choose
to
farm
because
of
the
way
they
are
able
to
interact
with
their
environment
and
community
through
growing
and
selling
food
spending
days
outdoors
and
always
learning
Although
Benji
and
Carys
have
developed
a
profitable
farming
model
economic
growth
is
not
their
primary
goal
rather
they
strive
to
maintain
a
balanced
lifestyleMahonia
